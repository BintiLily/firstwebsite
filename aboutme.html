        <h3> About Me </h3>
    </div>

    <div class = "para1">

    <p>My name is Lilian and I was born in&nbsp;<b>London</b>&nbsp;and originally come from&nbsp;<b>Tanzania</b>.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>Currently residing in&nbsp;<b>Greater Manchester</b>, where I have started my own family.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>I am a&nbsp;<b>Community Leader</b>&nbsp;within the Tanzanian Community.</p>
    <br>
    <p> My educational background is in&nbsp;<b>Media Production</b>&nbsp;and my work experience has been in Compliance within the&nbsp;<b>Logistics Industry</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After having my second child I moved to Swinton and I have been volunteering in a Woman's Charity leading different projects, my Community Role and I am currently trying to gain new skills by doing a sixteen week bootcamp for Data Analysis and Project Management for a career change; hence why I am here to learn coding which will assist with employment chances.</p> 
    <br> 
    <p>My Mother who is now retired, was a System Analyst and she taught me computers and created my email address back in the 90's that I still use to date. Back in the 90's my Mother did try to teach me programming but I just wasn't getting it. She is over the moon to hear I am coding again and I really do hope this will take me to new and exciting opportunities in the future.</p>
